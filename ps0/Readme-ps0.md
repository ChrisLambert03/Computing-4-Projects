## Description

This program uses the C++ SMFL library to open a window and display a green circle and a sprite png image.
It can also move in correspondence to the directional arrowkeys.

### Features

I search up a method to animate the sprite and came upon a github repository with those implementations
and applied them to my project.

### Issues

Although the picture still moves in the correct direction. The framerate of the sprite needs to be
tweaked a little to make the sprite keep walking

### Extra Feature

I was able to implement an Animated Sprite that can begin to walk int he direction of the keys including diagnol.
This uses a sprite png tilesheet that will display the different tiles within png in correspondence with the keys

## Integrity

I think that when it comes to this class there will always be difficulties in plagiarizm. The problem is that copying and pasting code makes it very easy to plagiarize with or without intention and the detection software makes it easy to detect
those patterns. I think a good portion of plagirizing code mostly falls unde tthe lack of credibility. Because there is a lot of free and open soure code people will always have access to it, but you need to mention what you are using in order not to
give off the impression that youre taking someone elses work.
