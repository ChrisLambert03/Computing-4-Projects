## Precept:

- This program fully works

- This assignment has an overloaded contructor allowing it to read in data from either the stdin or a parameter of a filename.
  The program then reads and parses through the data which contains planets cordinates, velocity and image filename.
  The data will get translated into Celestial body objects that hold planet data and the Universe object that holds
  the number of plants and the number to scale down to. The program will then map the planets to is corresponding cordinates and eventually will translate/transform each frame of the gif to mimick orbital patterns. The animation will continue until until the specifiecd stop and step times given as command line arguments. After that the program will output the current stare of the universe in the same format of the previously inputted file. The data structures mainly used in the project was a vector of unique pointers that held the celestial body objects.

## Programming Assignment 4: N-Body Simulation

## Operating system (such as OS X or Windows): Windows Subsystem for Linux

## Machine (such as Dell Latitude, MacBook Pro): MSI-A11

## Text editor (such as DrJava): VsCode

## Hours to complete assignment (optional): ~8hours

## Extra Credit:

- I placed a background image of a galaxy in my window and scaled it to fit the screen
- I displayed the elapsed time on the window. The time is updated at the title bar.
