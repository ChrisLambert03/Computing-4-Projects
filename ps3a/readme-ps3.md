# PS2a: Sokoban

## Contact

Name: Chris Lambert
Section: 201
Time to Complete: ~3 hours

## Description

This project mimics a game of Sokoban, a block puzzle.

### Features

I would say one major decision i made was to use dynamic memory so i can iterate over the objects i want drawn

### Memory

I used dynamic memory to load the textures from the provided images

### Lambdas

In used lambda functions that return a reference to directly manipulate the player's location as well as the surrounding blocks when the player moves. also i used lambdas to swap those references based on where the players going

### Issues

My pulse audio refuses to connect but i still tried to implement the sound. I know it plays because a pulseaudio error pops up when i win the game

### Extra Credit

I made the player change orientation based on its recent move. (up, down, left, right)
