## Name: Chris Lambert

## NetID: 01973715

## Precept:

- This assignment reads in data from either the stdin or a parameter of a filename.
  The program then reads and parses through the data which contains planets cordinates, velocity and image filename.
  The data will get parsed into Celestial body objects that hold planet data and the Universe that holds
  the number of plants and the number to scale down to. The program will then map the planets to is corresponding cordinates and eventually will translate/transform each frame of the gif to mimick orbital patterns

## Programming Assignment 4: N-Body Simulation

## Operating system (such as OS X or Windows): Windows Subsystem for Linux

## Machine (such as Dell Latitude, MacBook Pro): MSI-A11

## Text editor (such as DrJava): VsCode

## Extra Credit: I placed a background image of a galaxy in my window and scaled it to fit the screen
